This repository will contain lecture slides, source code examples, 
homeworks and solutions.  Lecture slides, homeworks, and solutions
will also be posted on blackboard, but source code examples will remain
in version control.

I highly recommend all students use version control for their source code
and NON-CODE files. 

You can put non-text files in git, this includes binary files, images, 
powerpoints, pdfs, and datasets.  Just use git-lfs.  Look it up.
For non-source-code files there should be one line for that file type
in your .gitattributes file.
